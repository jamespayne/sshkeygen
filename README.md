sshkeygen
=========

A bash ssh keygen script to make generating ssh keys easy.

Look at the script before you use it. Although I have checked it works and I'm fairly sure its safe providing you enter a password when generating the keys, I take no responsibility for any damage this script causes.

Feel free to contribute and / or make suggestions.
