sshkeygen
=========

A bash script to automate generating ssh keys.

Note: This script assumes you haven't already generated a ssh key. I'm going to update the script so that it checks for the prescence of existing keys and asks whether you want to use an existing key.

Look at the script before you use it. Although I have checked it works and I'm fairly sure its safe providing you enter a password when generating the keys, I take no responsibility for any damage this script causes.

Be sure to make it executable before you use it for example:

```chmod +x sshkeygen```

Feel free to contribute and / or make suggestions.
